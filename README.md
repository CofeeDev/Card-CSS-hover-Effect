# Add more links
 I tried to make the homepage the simpliest possible, so I only added a few SVG icons from FrontAweson.
 If you want to add more icon, go to IcoMoon and copy the code of the icon you want
 #### the code looks like this:
    
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>

then paste it on line 33 to 21 with the class: "Icon-Image" in the HTML5
 
# Change background color
to change the background color of a card, change the color on line 46 or 61 you can also add grandient in the CSS3
